/*
  Program Goal:
  The goal of this program is to read the state of a push button with a pull-up resistor using the 'pb' (push button) pin and display its value on the Serial Monitor.
  Additionally, the program controls the state of three LEDs (red, green, and blue) based on the button state. When the button is not pressed, the red and green LEDs are turned on, and the blue LED is turned off. 
  When the button is pressed, the red and blue LEDs are turned on, and the green LED is turned off.

  Main Theme:
  The main theme of this program is to demonstrate digital input with a pull-up using the 'pb' pin, which is connected to a push button. The state of the button is read and displayed on the Serial Monitor.
  The program also utilizes digital output to control the 'red,' 'green,' and 'blue' LEDs, creating different lighting effects based on the button state.
