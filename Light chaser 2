/*
Program goal:
The goal of this program is to demonstrate the use of 5 different pins of the Arduino. The progam is a sequential LED flasher that goes back and forth

Main theme: 
The main theme of this program is to demonstrate 5 digital output. Here we use digitalWrite to turn on the first pin and then turn off the previous pin with a delay function in between.
