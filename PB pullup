/*
  Program Goal:
  The goal of this program is to read the state of a push button with a pull-up resistor and display its value on the Serial Monitor. The LED turns off or on based on the button state.

  Main Theme:
  The main theme of this program is digital input with pull-up using a push button. The state of the button is read and displayed on the Serial Monitor. 
  We also use digital output to control the LED which is turned on when the button is pressed and turned off when released .

*/

int button = 7;  // Set button as a variable and give the value as 7
int led = 9;    // Set led as a variable and give the value as 9

void setup() {
  pinMode(button, INPUT_PULLUP);  // Set the button pin as an input with pull-up resistor
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);           // Set the led pin as an output
  Serial.begin(9600);               // Initialize the Serial Monitor
}

void loop() {
  int buttonState = digitalRead(button);  // Read the state of the button
  
  // Display the button state on the Serial Monitor
  if (buttonState == 0) {  // If the button is pressed 
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);  // Turn on the LED
    Serial.println("Pressed");
  } else { // if the button is not pressed
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);   // Turn off the LED
    Serial.println("Not pressed");
  }
