/*
  Program Goal:
  The goal of this program is to control the color of an RGB LED using three analog PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) signals.
  In this configuration, we set the red component to full intensity while keeping the green and blue components off, resulting in a solid red color.

  Main Theme:
  The main theme of this program is to demonstrate RGB LED control with analog signals. We are using three variables 'red,' 'green,' and 'blue' to represent
  the PWM-capable pins connected to the respective color channels of the RGB LED. 
  By using analogWrite, we can adjust the intensity of each color channel, allowing us to create various colors by mixing red, green, and blue.

int red = 12;   // Define the 'red' variable and set it to pin 12
int green = 9;  // Define the 'green' variable and set it to pin 9
int blue = 7;   // Define the 'blue' variable and set it to pin 7

void setup() {
  // No setup code is needed for this example.
}

void loop() {
  // Set the red component to full intensity (255), while keeping the green and blue components off (0).
  analogWrite(red, 255);
  analogWrite(green, 0);
  analogWrite(blue, 0);
}
