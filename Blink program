/*
Program goal:
The goal of this program is to demonstrate the turn on and off of an LED with the Arduino. The LED turns on and off after 1 sec or 1 millisecond.

Main theme: 
The main theme of this program is to demonstrate the digital output using pinMode and OUTPUT using an LED. Here we use digitalWrite to turn on and off the pin.

 
*/
int led = 12; // Set led as a variable and give the value as 12

void setup() {
  
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT); // Set the led pin as an output
}


void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH); // Turn on the led pin
  delay(1000); // Pause for 1 second 
  digitalWrite(led, LOW); // Turn off the led pin
  delay(1000); // Pause for 1 second                      
}
