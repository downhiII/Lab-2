/*
Program goal:
The goal of this program is to demonstrate the use of RGB, red green and blue LED . The RGB LED will cycle through various colors in a sequence.

Main theme: 
The main theme of this program is to demonstrate 3 digital output. Here we use digitalWrite to turn on the first pin and then turn off the previous pin with a delay function in between.
